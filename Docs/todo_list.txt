1. Parse training data
    a. Split Categorical and Continuous Data
    b. convert Categorical strings into its integer counterparts
    c. Convert Continuous data into a normal distribution for Gaussian Naive Bayes
2. Perform training tests
    a. Fit the training data to the NB model
    b. Run prediction tests on the model
    c. need some form of confirmed accuracy
3. Parse testing data
    a. perform similar changes on testing data as the training data
    b. note setup_train() currently discards the id column for the fitting to perform naturally
     testing will need a method to keep the id's in the solution file
    c. format the solution file to specified format
4. Prepare solution
    a. Write-up/report on assignment
    b. create files for upload
